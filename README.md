1a) A class is a template that describes the attributes and behaviors of an object. An instance of a class, is a specific instance of the class that contains its own set of values for the attributes defined in the class.

1b) inheritance Could be used in the Parent GUI CC to extend specific attributes to a UI class. Employees can contain different attributes that are common for all employees, while a subclass of a specific employee can extend upon the main class.

1c) Libraries already have pre built functions. Libraries will allow for more development and much of the time saved can be used to create more options

2b) Because of variables are declared private, access methods are needed to allow access to the variables because their variables can't be accessed outside of this class.
